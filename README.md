# Enhanced-WSN-Lifetime-Using-Dynamic-Multi-Hop-Clustering-and-Reinforcement-Learning-Q-Learning-
This is my Final Year Major Project. 
📌 Overview

This project explores how Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can live longer ⚡ by using AI-powered Q-Learning 🧠 and multi-hop clustering 🔗.
Instead of traditional protocols (LEACH, HEED, PEGASIS, SEP, TEEN), we designed a smarter approach that balances energy and improves communication.

🚀 Key Highlights

✨ Dynamic Cluster Head (CH) selection using Reinforcement Learning
✨ Smarter multi-hop routing to reduce energy drain
✨ Benchmarked vs classic protocols (LEACH, HEED, PEGASIS, SEP, TEEN)
✨ Metrics: Energy ⛽ | Latency ⏳ | PDR 📦 | Throughput 📊
